This provides the imediff command and git-ime command.

## What is imediff

The imediff command helps you to merge 2 slightly different files with an
optional base file interactively using the in-place alternating display of the
changed content on a single-pane full screen terminal user interface.

The source of line is clearly identified by the color of the line or the
identifier character at the first column.

The advantage of this user interface is the minimal movement of the line of
sight for the user.

The line matching logic of imediff has been improved to ignore whitespaces and
use partial line matches to provide the best presentation with small chunk of
lines.

The automatic 3 way merge logic of the imediff command operates not only on the
difference by line but on the difference by character.  This is another great
feature of the imediff command. So for the non-overlapping changes, it always
yields the clean merge.

When imediff is invoked with "-n" option, it yields normal diff-output for 2
files and 3-way-merged-output like "diff3 -m" without opening full screen
terminal user interface.  This 3-way-merged-output is smarter than "diff3 -m".
This "-n" can be used with "-f" to generate word-diff-like output, too.

NOTE: There seems to be some limitation (16K?) of acceptable input lines for
imediff program running under full screen.  This causes imediff to crash.  The
root cause seems to be the underlining ncurses binding which imediff uses.

## What is git-ime

The "git ime" command helps you to unsquash 2 consecutive commits (`HEAD^`,
`HEAD`) of a git repository.  The "`git rebase -i <treeish>`" and "`gitk`" can
be used to organize unsquashed changes.

If any staged changes or local uncommitted changes are found in the git
repository, "git ime" immediately exits without changes to be on the safe side.

If the latest commit involves multiple files, "git ime" splits this big commit
by the file into multiple smaller commits involving a single file for each
commit.

If the latest commit involves only a single file, the commit is split into
multiple smaller commits involving a set of minimal partial changes by imediff
to be managed interactively later.

This "git ime" is not only useful at the checked out branch head but also at
"edit" prompt during the interactive execution of "`git rebase -i <treeish>`".
Execute "git ime" after committing the pending commit.

## Quick start for Debian/Ubuntu derivative users

Please install the `imediff` package from the APT repository.

At the console command line prompt, type:
 * "imediff" to read the tutorial,
 * "imediff -h" to get all the command line options,
 * "imediff -o output older newer" to merge 2 files, and
 * "imediff -o output yours base theirs" to merge 3 files.

For usage instructions, type "h" and "H" in the interactive display.

(The use of GNU gettext is disabled for the sake of portability.)

## History and features

This was originally written by Jarno Elonen in Python2. The latest original
upstream version was 1.1.2 released on 2007-8-18.

The original author's website was https://elonen.iki.fi/code/imediff/ .  Now it
redirects to this site https://github.com/osamuaoki/imediff .

Osamu Aoki made a minor patched release for Debian buster in Oct 2018.

 * No more surprise hitting "q".  You will be asked. (Fix Debian bug #799865)
 * Fix manpage generation issue (Fix Debian bug #860351)
 * New git-ime wrapper script (great for git rebase/un-squash commit)
 * You can customize key bindings.

Osamu also wanted to add some features:

 * Use of Python3 with setup.py and setuptools to organize the source into
   multiple source files.
 * Use standard libraries for the flexible customization (argparse,
   configparser, logging)
 * Addition of diff3 merge capability
 * Addition of wdiff capability
 * Addition of cursor location display capability
 * Make it edit highlighted section only
 * Make its TUI more friendly under monochrome terminal
 * Use curses.wrapper()
 * CLI and logging interface for easy self-testing/debugging
 * Add decent test cases
 * Include simple tutorial within "imediff".
 * Add "git-mergetool" integration.
 * Add "git-ime" to help making partial patch series commits to git.
 * Good CJK wide character support with East_Asian_Width on console.

This was accomplished by practically a whole rewrite of the source code in
November-December 2018.  Osamu decided to release this as imediff after
consulting with Jarno Elonen. Now program name is without "2", since it
supports diff for not only 2 files but also 3 files.  The version number is
bumped to 2.0.  In version 2.5, line matching rules are updated to produce
better diff presentation.

## Note to non-Debian/Ubuntu derivative users

The building of rpm or wheel are not supported as out-of-box now (patch
welcome).

Since this is packaged with setuptools, I recommend to create a wheel package
first and install it with `pip` or `pipx` to the system.

You must have the full python 3.9 environment.  Corresponding packages for the
following Debian packages are needed.

* python3-minimal  -- include all the Python standard libraries (curses)
* python3-distutils -- You need this for `setup.py`
* python3-setuptools -- You need this for `setup.py`

These 3 packages are available if the platform system supports Python 3.9.  It
seems some older Python 3 seems to cause problem with the current `setup.py` +
`setup.cfg` combination probably due to the use of new archive style using
`src/` directory.

Since older version did not have this problem, I created the `alternative`
branch which should support such older system.  Also, I backported `git-ime` to
this `alternative` branch.

For the build dependencies listed in `debian/control`, `debhelper-compat` and
`dh-python` are purely for the Debian package building, so these are not
essential for other platforms.

If you wish to update manpage from XML, `docbook-xsl` and `xsltproc` are needed
for building manpage from xml source then manually touch up details.

Code is not written for Windows compatibility in mind, yet.

The `git-ime` command requires you to have some POSIX shell and the `git`
command access.

## Note to developer and translator

### making Debian package

You can make your own Debian package as:

```sh
 $ git clone https://github.com/osamuaoki/imediff.git
 $ cd imediff
 $ git checkout main
  ... hack source
 $ git commit -a
 $ rm -rf debian
 $ git add -A .
 $ git commit
 $ git tag 2.5
 $ git reset --hard HEAD^
 $ git deborig # to make ../*.orig.tar.xz
 $ sbuild
 $ cd ..
 $ sudo dpkg -i imediff_2.5-1_all.deb
```

Here, we assume the upstream version to be 2.5, and the Debian revision to be
1.

If you have bug fixes or feature enhancement propose changes to me via "pull
request"

### updating manpages

Please make sure to fit each code below 80-88 chars. (Run "black" on python
code)  In case if reformat errors, check its syntax by:

```sh
 $ python3 -m py_compile program.py
```

Manpages need to be updated from XML files with "make" first in doc/ directory
when you edit it.

### testing code

If you make changes, please test then.

To test the in-source-tree module, invoke the test script from setup.py in the
root of the source tree as:

```sh
 $ python3 setup.py test
```

To test the installed module, invoke the test script directly as:

```sh
 $ cd test
 $ python3 test_diff23lib.py -v
```
