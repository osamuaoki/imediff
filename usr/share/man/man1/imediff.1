.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Merge two (slightly different) files with an optional common base file interactively with a user friendly fullscreen interface in the full screen text terminal mode\&.
.PP
\fBimediff\fR
shows the differences of given two files (in color if the terminal supports them), lets you scroll the file and toggle changes between older and newer version for each chunk of difference\&. You can also select line diff and character wdiff mode for display\&. If you wish to make manual changes, you can edit each chunk with editor\&. The result of merge operation is saved in
\fIfile_out\fR\&.
.PP
Additionally, you can customize your choice of editor via
\fI$EDITOR\fR
or
~/\&.imediff\&. The default editor is
\fB/usr/bin/editor\fR\&.
.PP
Removed lines are shown in reversed \*(Aq???\*(Aq as a placeholder, so you see that and you can select them\&. While it takes one line on display, it is naturally not saved into the output file\&.
.PP
To see the key binding, hit
h
in the main
\fBimediff\fR
screen\&.
.PP
To see the tutorial, hit
H
in the main
\fBimediff\fR
screen or simply start the
\fBimediff\fR
command without arguments\&.
.PP
The program exits with status 0 if the changes were saved, 1 if the merging was aborted and 2 if the parameters were invalid\&.
